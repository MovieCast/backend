The MovieCast Backend is the heart of MovieCast. It:
- Has a convienient RESTful API to find movies and tv shows.
- Looks for movie metadata from from Trakt.tv.
- Looks for tv show metadata from Trakt.tv.
- Searches the web for high quality movie and episode torrents.
- Searches the web for synced subtitles.

> The MovieCast Backend is currently in a very early development phase.
> The API exposed by this backend may undergo some major changes
> and it is thereby not recommended to build a service on top of it yet.
